Cannonical diagrams
===================

These are Machinations diagrams (saved in XML format using Mr. Dormans' Web Tool) whose objetive is to show what behaviour you can expect from Rachinations.

There are two types of file: those ending in 'similarities.xml' show behaviour that is identical in Machinations and Rachinations. Those ending in 'differences.xml' show examples of cases where Machinations and Rachinations behave in slightly different ways.

For best results, import these into Mr. Dormans' Machinations Web Tool and run them using Asynchronous time mode and Instantaneous distribution.
