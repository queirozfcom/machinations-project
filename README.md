### Introduction

This is a port of Dr. J. Dormans' [Machinations framework](http://www.jorisdormans.nl/machinations/) into Ruby.

It provides a Ruby-based DSL to enable game designers to create and also test tentative game designs and/or prototypes.

### Contents

- Classes to model the domain
- Tests
- A simple DSL (Domain-specific language) whose objective is to enable anyone to write Machinations diagrams, run them, obtain metrics, compose subdiagrams and so on.
